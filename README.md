In 2013, quinoa had its big break. Brazil The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations declared that year the “International Year of Quinoa,” and a flurry of newspaper and scholarly articles talked about this new food called quinoa. It seemed to appear out of nowhere, and it had wonderful nutritional properties – high protein, essential vitamins and minerals, gluten-free.[^1]  For its exceptional nutrition and exoticness people began calling it a “superfood.” For several years already and especially following 2013, consumers around the world began adding it to salads for a protein boost, substituting it for rice to eliminate carbs, and experimenting with it in baked goods. And yet we hardly knew where it came from, the farmers who cultivated it, what quinoa meant to them before the quinoa boom, and the impact of the food trend on these communities.

In fact, quinoa has a long history, dating back several thousand years to the Andean region of South America, where it was typically grown as a subsistence food by farmers in what is today Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. The quinoa boom has brought new opportunities and challenges to the Andes, making the situation a complex interplay between local farmers, state policies, and international consumer preferences. The anthropologist Emma McDonnell argues that quinoa has become a “miracle crop,” identified by problematic terms such as “superfood,” but the realities regarding quinoa have been much more tempered than the lofty aspirations of some promoters.[^2]  Plants are crucial to our diets, and yet we rarely think about how the nutritional interests of one country can impact the nutritional possibilities of another far away. Understanding how quinoa transformed from an isolated Andean subsistence crop to an international “superfood” is important when considering issues of food justice, sustainability, and the next food trend or diet fad that mythologizes a forgotten plant.

### Botanical Properties of Quinoa

The word quinoa comes from Quechua, one of many Indigenous languages spoken in the Andes. Quinoa is in the genus Chenopodium or the goosefoot family, so-called because the leaves resemble the three-pointed feet of a goose. There are about 250 species in the Chenopodium family, and quinoa is the most well-known. Closely related species include lambs’ quarters (Chenopodium album), a common species of the same genus found around the world and widely considered a weed, and amaranth and spinach, in the same family (_Amaranthaceae_).

In 1725 Louis Feuillée authored the first scientific description of quinoa along with a botanical engraving.[^3]  Carl Ludwig Willdenow, who was likely the first to cultivate quinoa successfully in European gardens, assigned it its binomial taxonomic name Chenopodium quinoa in 1798.[^4]  Compared to many other South American wild plants and cultivated crops, quinoa was introduced rather late to European botanical gardens and taxonomy.[^5]

### The Importance of Quinoa in Ancient Andean Diets

Since quinoa is native to the Andes, it is most associated with the Inca Empire, which the Spanish conquistadors defeated in the mid-sixteenth century. But quinoa was domesticated and important to Andean diets long before the Inca empire. It is unclear how important quinoa was to Incan diets and culture, but Incas also referred to quinoa as chisiya mama, or Mother Grain.[^6]

Archaeological evidence suggests that quinoa was likely first domesticated more than 5000 years ago in the Altiplano – a high-elevation plateau approximately 4,000 meters above sea level in a region of South America that spans present-day Bolivia and Peru, near Lake Titicaca. The domestication process highlights the important relationship between plants, humans, and animals.[^7]  Before Andean peoples in the altiplano region became large-scale agriculturalists, they were predominately pastoralists, herding llamas and alpacas, two domesticated camelid species. Archaeologists have concluded that camelids would eat the wild species of quinoa, release the seeds in their droppings near herding communities, and wild quinoa seeds would sprout nearby. Over time, ancient Andeans would come to formally cultivate quinoa. The mutualistic relationship, then, between camelids, quinoa, and people allowed for quinoa to become domesticated thousands of years ago.[^8] 

Today and in the past, quinoa is recognized for its exceptional nutritional qualities. Indigenous people also considered it healthy because of its medicinal properties, although Europeans mostly ignored these attributes of quinoa. The famed sixteenth century colonial chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, son of a Spanish conquistador and Inca noblewoman, explained that “The Indian inhabitants use flour made of quinoa in various illnesses.”[^9]  Today’s ethnobotanical researchers have documented that quinoa has been used to treat broken bones, by immobilizing limbs or making poultices.[^10]  Quinoa was also used in coca chewing, a long-standing tradition among Indigenous Andean peoples. To extract the stimulant properties of coca, Andeans made llipta, an alkaline ash powder, often made from quinoa stalks, to extract the coca alkaloids. Coca alleviated altitude sickness, fatigue, and hunger (most Andean communities in the highlands are higher than 3000 meters above sea level).

### Quinoa in the Colonial Period

Spanish colonization brought significant changes to farmers growing quinoa. As part of the Columbian Exchange, Spaniards brought wheat, barley, rice, and other crops from the Old World and introduced them to Andean farming systems. Spanish colonial policies made Indigenous people pay a tribute tax, which could only be paid in wheat or barley. As the geographer Karl Zimmerer explains, this policy essentially forced farmers to grow less quinoa and more European crops. Nevertheless, Indigenous people continued to grow quinoa, despite the impositions of Spanish colonialism.[^11]

In an illustrated chronicle written in 1615 in the form of a letter to the king of Spain, the Indigenous nobleman Guaman Poma de Ayala explained the agricultural habits of Indigenous Andeans. Alongside quinoa they grew potatoes, oca, maize, coca, and many other plants. In September they planted quinoa. While the Incas did not have a writing system, they still devised a way to maintain important records on knotted threads called a quipu. While present day scholars have not discovered how to read quipus, it is likely that they served more as a memory device rather than a formal writing system. Guaman Poma explained that “\[The Royal Accountant\] kept track of the amount of wool of the deer called _taruca_, that of the the Indians, and the food called quinoa. He counted the quinoa and the Indians. He was very capable, as if he used paper and ink.”[^12] In this context, Guaman Poma relayed to the Spanish king quinoa's place in sophisticated Andean administrative methods.

In general, Spanish colonizers rejected all types of Indigenous foods in part because they associated it with Indigenous people and in part because they suspected that the foreign foods would do harm to their bodies.[^13] Over time, countless New World foods, such as maize, chocolate, peppers, tomatoes, pineapples, and potatoes became widely popular.[^14]  Some of the earliest Spanish explorers and chroniclers of the Andes were fascinated by quinoa, but it took much longer for quinoa to become popular outside the Andes compared to other plants. Garcilaso explained that both Indigenous people and Spaniards enjoyed quinoa in various soups and stews “for they are tasty and very nourishing.”[^15]

Whether or not the Spanish really did enjoy quinoa as much as Garcilaso suggests is not entirely clear. For one, the tribute policy and the continual decline in quinoa production throughout the colonial period suggest that quinoa was not quite so venerated. Sometimes called the first “mestizo” – a person of mixed Indigenous and Spanish descent – Garcilaso sought to defend racial mixing at a time when Spaniards denounced mestizos. Nevertheless, Garcilaso offers an excellent early account of Indigenous customs, including quinoa consumption. He continued, Indigenous people also made quinoa into a beverage, brewing it along with maize into a beer known as chicha. Today, chicha remains an important part of Andean societies, although it is most often made exclusively with corn. Before a large agricultural work party, an offering is made to Pachamama (Mother Earth) in which each member pours a few drops of chicha onto the soil before taking a sip.[^16]

### Early Descriptions of Quinoa

Many plants and animals from the Americas that crossed the Atlantic as part of the Columbian Exchange shocked and mystified Europeans. Spanish conquistadors were once wary of now ubiquitous foods like corn, chocolate, tobacco, and potatoes based on racist perceptions of Indigenous people. Because maize was so important to Indigenous diets throughout the Americas, Spaniards analogized the crop to wheat. As the food historian Rebecca Earle explains, church officials debated the extent to which wheat and corn were the same. For the Catholic ritual of communion, Europeans would always use wheat, but Spaniards debated whether maize could be used instead in the colonies. Ultimately, they decided that maize was not a suitable replacement, and as Earle describes, corn became a sort of “anti-wheat.”[^17] Analogies also applied to New World animals. Initially, llamas and alpacas, central in Andean cultures and foodways, were likened to sheep. Europeans used terms like “Peruvian sheep” or “Indian sheep” despite quite different physical features, behaviors, and Indigenous husbandry practices.[^18]

Quinoa was not immune to these sorts of misunderstandings or faulty analogies. Garcilaso de la Vega compared quinoa to rice or millet because of its size and shape. Questionable comparisons lingered well into the nineteenth century. In 1839 Curtis’s Botanical Magazine, a prominent English garden and botanical magazine, said quinoa is “like the Corn in Europe (corn in this case meaning staple cereals of Europe, mainly wheat, barley, or oats), the ‘chief nourishment of the people’.” The magazine was exaggerating; quinoa was certainly important, but potatoes would have been, and still are, the central component of Andean diets. The magazine goes on to explain that after boiling quinoa like rice or oatmeal, “the seeds are described as floating in the liquid coiled up and looking like little white worms.”[^19]

### The International Community Latches onto Quinoa

Since the recent rise in international interest in quinoa, scholars in a variety of disciplines have begun to study more closely the scientific properties, politics, economics, and cultural importance of quinoa. Quinoa serves as a good case study to understand the possibilities and limitations of Western and Andean traditions. As the anthropologist Linda Seligmann writes, “The story of quinoa highlights points of incommensurability in the Andes between Indigenous and western perspectives, especially around politics, land, and social relationships, but also shows how problematic it is to romanticize Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies.”[^20]  As a result, quinoa has become a useful plant to conceive of new global relationships to food, crops, and natural resources and the potential challenges of doing so.

Scientists and international development agencies, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), have hailed quinoa as an important crop to alleviate the challenges of global hunger and the world’s food supply exacerbated by climate change and a narrowing of crop diversity.  Wheat, rice, and corn make up 60% of all calories consumed, and we rely on very few varieties of those crops. This means that pests, diseases, and unforeseen climate disasters could dramatically impact global public health. As such, policymakers and leaders have encouraged diversifying diets and the genetic makeup of agricultural farms. In 2011, Bolivian officials claimed that quinoa was an “ancient crop to contribute to world food security.”[^21] The FAO agreed and thus was born the International Year of Quinoa.

Why does quinoa seem to have so much potential? In short, because of its nutritional, ecological, and cultural characteristics. Nutritionally, quinoa is better than many other grain crops, such as wheat, rice, or barley. Most notably, it is very high in protein, consisting of approximately 15% protein by mass, almost twice as much compared to rice and slightly higher than wheat. The quality of the protein is better, too. Scientists determined that quinoa “is one of the few plants that provide all the amino acids necessary for human life, and contrary to grain proteins poor in especially lysines, quinoa proteins are accepted as high-quality proteins.”[^22]

While scientists now have a much better understanding of how and why quinoa is nutritionally superior to other grains, the first chemical analysis to determine quinoa’s exceptional composition was performed in 1850! Augustus Voelcker, a chemist at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, England, determined that quinoa contains 19% protein by mass, not far off from today’s estimates. It would take almost a century and a half, however, for quinoa’s nutrition facts to be widely appreciated.[^23]

Ecologically, quinoa is adapted to many different types of growing environments. This is because there are thousands of different quinoa varieties, sometimes called ecotypes. If one just looks at the shelves of an American grocery store, it may seem that there are only three types of quinoa: white, black, and red. But quinoa varieties differ more than just based on color. Of the thousands of quinoa varieties, there are five broad categories they can be classified in based on geography. These include the coasts of Chile, the inter-Andean valley regions, the altiplano (high-plateau) region that spans Peru and Bolivia, the Yungas, which are the eastern slopes of the Andes, and the salt-flats of Bolivia. Each of these geographies has different climates based on altitude, rainfall, temperature, and soil conditions.[^24]  As a result, seed saving efforts around the world have collected thousands of quinoa seed specimens from subsistence farmers to preserve quinoa’s high genetic diversity and climate adaptability.

### Quinoa Nutrition Goes Global and Changes Indigenous Livelihoods

To arrive at the International Year of Quinoa, the plant rode several waves to international stardom. First, there was a growing interest in shamanism and non-Western traditions among American counterculture movements in the late twentieth century. Although there is no definitive history of how quinoa became so popular among American consumers, according to some accounts, this worldview was an impetus for introducing quinoa into health food grocery stores in the 1980s (see for example McCammant, Chilies to Chocolate). Second, diet trends like low-carb or gluten-free diets push eaters towards alternative grains, and quinoa, having no gluten and low amounts of carbohydrates, has made it a good candidate for several recent food fads. Finally, quinoa became associated with fine dining thanks to a recent culinary movement in Peru called “novoandino” cuisine that combines European fine dining aesthetics and tastes with traditional Andean ingredients.[^25] “Quinotto”—a risotto made from quinoa—created by Bernardo Roca Rey in the 1980s, is considered the dish that sparked the novoandino gastronomy movement that has since made Peruvian cuisine world famous (Maria Elena Garcia).

Since the International Year of Quinoa, journalists and scholars have hotly debated whether the quinoa boom has improved or exploited the lives of Indigenous quinoa farmers. On the one hand, proponents argue that profits return to the communities and stimulate economic growth. On the other hand, critics point out that Western consumption of quinoa is yet another example of cultural appropriation of an important Indigenous resource that does not adequately compensate the communities that have cultivated it for centuries and ultimately makes it too expensive for those communities to consume. There does not seem to be a perfect solution to these ethical and economic challenges.

One potential problem for quinoa growers in the Andes is the introduction of commercial quinoa farming in the United States, China, or elsewhere in the world that may be able to produce more quinoa at a lower price and outcompete Andean farmers in the market. While this has not happened yet, it is not an entirely new fear. In 1994, American researchers patented an improved variety of quinoa based off seeds cultivated by Bolivian farmers. In response, the National Association of Quinoa Producers (ANAPQUI) in Bolivia fiercely challenged the patent, arguing that the patent stole intellectual property from the Indigenous farmers. The patent was upheld but the owners ultimately let it expire in 1998. Spurred by the memory of this event, the 2009 Bolivian constitution makes explicit that the state controls, monitors, and regulates biological and genetic resources.[^26] This may prevent international biopriacy, the unauthorized exploitation of biological knowledge or resources. But even the state-controlled solution is not perfect. As Emma McDonnell writes in the Peruvian context, “As indigenous farming communities lose control over quinoa’s genetic resources, they become consumers of seeds created in state and private laboratories and no longer are they the key decision-makers regarding quinoa [plant genetic resources].”[^27]

The patent disputes and present-day issues of Indigenous and state sovereignty over potentially valuable plant resources show that the ethical dilemmas of quinoa consumption go beyond questions of profits and fair compensation in the short-term. Mineral prospecting and extraction near quinoa farms, also supposed to increase the standard of living for highland Andean communities, threaten the sustainability of quinoa production for Peruvian farmers as the two industries are fundamentally at odds with one another.[^28] Overall, quinoa’s history forces us to question whether and how we can improve global nutrition by eating foods from around the world while protecting the interests of the communities that have stewarded those foods for centuries.
